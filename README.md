# RISC-V CPU

This repository contains an HDL implementation of a **RISC V** core, implementing the RV32I Base Integer Instruction Set, as specified in [this document](https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-manual/releases/download/Ratified-IMAFDQC/riscv-spec-20191213.pdf 'RISCV Specifications'). It is a single issue, in-order core developed to be used as a starting point for further development in digital design of computer architectures for embedded and general purpose systems.
